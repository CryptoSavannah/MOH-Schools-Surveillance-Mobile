# Surveillance Mobile App

Mobile App written in React-Native and has read and write permissions to a Blockchain to record cases and retrieve case information for a specific school. The mobile application purposes to collect patient data at treatment centers in schools. 

## Setup

This project was built using expo cli (https://github.com/expo/expo-cli).

## Outline

* Available scripts
* Networking
* Testing
* Customizing App Display, Name, Theme and Icon
* License

## Available Scripts

If Yarn was installed when the project was initialized, then dependencies will have been installed via Yarn, and you should probably use it to run these commands as well. Unlike dependency installation, command running syntax is identical for Yarn and NPM at the time of this writing.

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache

```

### `expo start`

Starts the expo cli build and the app runs in development mode.

### Networking

The app interracts with the block chain. Open .... file and set variables for the blockchain that has been set up for interfacing.

### Troubleshooting

Logs are displayed on the expo client on the phone, and a console started using the expo cli.

## Customizing App Display Name and Icon

You can edit `app.json` to include [configuration keys](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/configuration.html) under the `expo` key.

To change your app's display name, set the `expo.name` key in `app.json` to an appropriate string.

To set an app icon, set the `expo.icon` key in `app.json` to be either a local path or a URL. It's recommended that you use a 512x512 png file with transparency.
